# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator will give options to create either a basic or cloze flashcard.  It will loop through 2x and then console.log the parts of the completed cards.  If you choose to create cloze cards, it will run a test to make sure that the cloze part and fulltext part are entered correctly.

Notes:  There are a few files included here that are for future incarnations of this app and do not have obvious functionality yet.
The index.html file is for a front-end representation of the flash-cards in the browser which is not yet connected.
The basiclog.txt and clozelog.txt files receive the entered text and may eventually provide a way to retrieve the text for the flashcards without having to enter it in each session.
